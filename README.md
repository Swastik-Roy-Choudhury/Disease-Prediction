# Disease Prediction Toolkit: Save Lives with AI

## üìå Project Overview
The **Disease Prediction Toolkit** is a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of diseases (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) using real-world healthcare datasets. This project was developed as part of the **AI/ML Save Lives with AI Bootcamp** to help beginners gain hands-on experience in data science and healthcare AI applications.

## üéØ Objectives
- Learn **machine learning fundamentals** with healthcare data.
- Preprocess datasets: handle missing values, encode features, scale data.
- Train and evaluate ML models: **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest**.
- Compare model performance with **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**.
- Create a professional **GitHub portfolio** with code, documentation, and visualizations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Tools:** Google Colab / Replit, Kaggle Datasets  

## üìù Workflow
1. **Setup Environment:** Use Google Colab or Replit.  
2. **Dataset:** Load healthcare datasets (Heart Disease UCI, Diabetes from Kaggle).  
3. **Preprocessing:**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical features  
   - Feature scaling  
4. **Model Training:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.  
5. **Evaluation:**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC  
   - Visualizations: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve  
6. **Documentation:** Prepare README, toolkit scripts, visualizations, and presentation.  

## üìä Results
- **Best Model:** Random Forest (highest accuracy and ROC-AUC).  
- **Performance:** Reliable classification with strong generalization.  
- **Insights:** Ensemble learning outperformed single classifiers.  

## üöÄ Deliverables
- GitHub Repository with:
  - Preprocessing Scripts  
  - Model Training & Evaluation Scripts  
  - Visualizations & Test Cases  
  - README.md (this file)  
- Demo Video (30 seconds) showing predictions.  
- 5-Slide Presentation (project summary).  

## üí° Tips for Learners
- Use **Google Colab** for free GPU access and smooth setup.  
- Refer to **Scikit-learn documentation** for troubleshooting.  
- Engage with peers for code reviews and project feedback.  
- Keep documentation clear and portfolio-ready.  

## üìå Future Enhancements
- Expand toolkit to cover multiple diseases.  
- Integrate **deep learning models** (e.g., neural networks).  
- Deploy the toolkit as a **web application** for real-world use.
